This directory holds a first draft of a lexer and parser for the MDX multi-dimensional query language. It is unfortunate that a true specification for MDX is so hard to come by, however I have done my best to capture the initial elements of MDX queries. The grammar is defined using Dhaka (http://dhaka.rubyforge.org/) - you will need to install the Dhaka gem to generate the parser and lexer from the grammar and lexer specification (respectively).

The parser doesn't actually do anything yet, but hopefully I'll be able to put some time into it and get it working sometime in the near future.
